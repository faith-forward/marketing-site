			<p>
				By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should
				make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to
				copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not
				allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
				translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all
				the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
				to it, still belong to Lil Bro Co.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lil Bro Co is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
				that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services,
				at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
				making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Faith Forward app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to
				provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
				secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
				process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
				system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
				programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Faith Forward
				app won’t work properly or at all.
			</p>
			<p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
			<p>
				Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app: <a
					href="https://expo.dev/terms"
					class="text-blue">Expo</a
				>
			</p>
			<p>
				You should be aware that there are certain things that Lil Bro Co will not take
				responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
				internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
				provider, but Lil Bro Co cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
				functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
				allowance left.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of
				the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
				charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
				while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
				responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
				outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
				you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
				that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the same lines, Lil Bro Co cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
				app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
				and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Lil Bro Co cannot accept responsibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				With respect to Lil Bro Co’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the
				app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated
				and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
				we can make it available to you. Lil Bro Co accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
				indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
			</p>
			<p>
				At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the
				requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
				availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want
				to keep using the app. Lil Bro Co does not promise that it will always update the app so
				that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your
				device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to
				you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
				without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
				termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you
				must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
			</p>

				We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
				this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
